            INSTALLED _APPS = (
                ...
                'django.contrib.sites',  # Include the site framework if you haven't yet.
                ...
                'donation',
            )
        
        2. Include the donation URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^donate/' include('donation.urls.py)),
        
        3. Make sure the SITE_ID is correctly set in the settings and corresponds to right address in the database.
        
        4. Set the following constants in the settings::
        
            ``DONATION_NAME`` - a.k.a. product name for PayPal
            ``DONATOIN_NUMBER`` - something similar, but rather 'subproduct' name
            ``PAYPAL_ID`` - the PayPal Email address to receive donations
        
        4. Run `python manage.py syncdb` to create the donation models (and eventually the site table).
        
        6. For overwriting the app templates make sure the project template folder is set in the settings::
        
               TEMPLATE_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')]
        
           Include in the template that shall harbour the donation button the following line::
        
               {% include "donation/donate_form.html" %}
        
           Optional: Overwrite the donation/success.html and include the following line::
        
               {% include "donation/confirm_form.html" %}
